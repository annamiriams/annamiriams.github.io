                <p>I am a Portland, Oregon-based mental health professional and software developer. Through nearly a decade of work in the mental health field, I learned that I love creating systems, improving processes, and collaborating on tech-focused projects, especially when it means supporting people access essential services. I love people-centered, mission-driven software development that prioritizes user experience and accessibility.</p>

                <p>When I'm not at the computer, you'll find me birding, reading, or testing out a new recipe.</p>
