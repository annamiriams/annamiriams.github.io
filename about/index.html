                <p>I am a Portland, Oregon-based mental health professional and software developer. Through nearly a decade of work in the mental health field, I learned that I love creating systems, improving processes, and collaborating on tech-focused projects, especially when it means supporting people access essential services. I love people-centered, mission-driven software development that prioritizes user experience and accessibility.</p>
                <p>When I'm not at the computer, you'll find me birdwatching, reading, testing out a new recipe, or volunteering at my favorite dog rescue, One Tail at a Time.</p>
